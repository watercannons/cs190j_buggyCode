This is a possible list of conceptual questions

1.  Why don't the values swap (referring to the pass-by-value example).

(This was from someone in Lawton's class, referring to lecture slides on pass by value; some background, they have
not covered how to pass by reference, just why pass by value doesn't work.
Also, they haven't gone over scope D:)

2. What is ifs?

3. Why does the main function have the "main(int argc, char* argv[])?
    a. Follow up: what are the benefits of using command line arguments?
    b. Follow up: What is the purpose of the "if(argc != 2)" for?
